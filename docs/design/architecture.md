# Project Architecture Design

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural decisions and patterns used in this data science project.

## Directory Structure
The project follows a modular structure designed for scalability and maintainability:

- `data/`: Contains all data files, both raw and processed
- `docs/`: Project documentation
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `src/`: Source code modules
- `tests/`: Test files

## Code Organization

### Source Code (`src/`)
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Each module should have a single responsibility
- Follow Python package structure with `__init__.py` files
- Type hints required for all function parameters and return values

### Notebooks (`notebooks/`)
- Clear naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive_name.ipynb`
- Must include markdown documentation
- Output cells should be cleared before committing
- Large data visualizations should be saved to `data/figures/`

### Data Management
- Raw data stored in `data/raw/`
- Processed data stored in `data/processed/`
- Data versioning using DVC (Data Version Control)
- Data loading/saving utilities in `src/data/`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- PEP 8 compliance enforced through Black and Flake8
- Type checking with MyPy
- Unit tests required for all new features
- Documentation required for all public APIs

### Documentation
- All code changes require documentation updates
- API documentation using docstrings (Google style)
- Design decisions documented in `docs/design/`
- Requirements documented in `docs/requirements/`

### Version Control
- Feature branch workflow
- Semantic versioning
- Conventional commits
- Pull request reviews required

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for detailed package versions and purposes.

## Future Considerations
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Automated testing
- Documentation auto-generation
- Performance monitoring
- Security considerations
